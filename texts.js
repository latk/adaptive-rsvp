  "information system, abbreviated MIS. The financial hub of the MIS is accounting. Accounting is the information system " +
  "that records, analyzes, and reports economic transactions, enabling decision makers to make informed choices when allocating " +
  "scarce economic resources. It is a tool that enables the user, whether a business entity or an individual, " +
  "to make wiser, more informed economic choices. It is an aid to planning, controlling, and " +
  "evaluating a broad range of activities. A financial accounting system is intended for use by" +
  "both the management of an organization and those outside the organization.";

  "Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. " +
  "Consisting of both living and non-living components, this type of ecosystem " +
  "is found in the warm, clear, shallow waters of tropical oceans worldwide. " +
  "The functionality of the reefs ranges from providing food and shelter to fish " +
  "and other forms of marine life to protecting the shore from the ill effects of " +
  "erosion and putrefaction. In fact, reefs actually create land in tropical areas " +
  "by formulating islands and contributing mass to continental shorelines. Although " +
  "coral looks like a plant, it is mainly comprised of the limestone skeleton of a tiny animal called a coral polyp. While corals are the " +
  "main components of reef structure, they are not the only living participants. Coralline algae cement the myriad corals, and other " +
  "miniature organisms such as tubeworms and mollusks contribute skeletons to this dense and diverse structure. Together, these living " +
  "creatures construct many different types of tropical reefs. ";
