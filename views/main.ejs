            This experiment will help us to understand if automatically choosing the speed parameter for RSVP reading via our method is 
            the right approach.
            A text will be displayed using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation.Try to understand as much information
            as possible. At the end of the reading session, you will be asked few questions regarding the corresponding text.
            This will help us to measure your comprehensibility while using RSVP.
            <br>Thank you.

          Click on the word to <i>pause/play</i> or <i>spacebar</i>, <i>use left and right arrows</i> to stop and go backwards or forwards. If you
          find the presentation too fast/slow, use the <i>arrow keys (up/down)</i> to manually adjust it.
